This model is designed to take input of the user details and provide them the insurance charges accordingly

# 🧠 Ridge Regression with Multiple Features: Scratch vs Sklearn

This project compares Ridge Regression models trained manually vs scikit-learn implementation to predict **medical insurance charges** based on age, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.

## 💡 What’s Covered

- **From Scratch:** L2-regularized cost function and gradient descent
- **Scikit-learn:** `Ridge` from `sklearn.linear_model`
- **Target:** Medical Charges
- **Features:** Age, BMI, Children, Smoker

## 🌐 Live App

Compare both models using real-time input:

## 📁 Files

- `From_Scratch.ipynb`: Notebook implementing both models
- `app.py`: Streamlit app to interact with models
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages needed

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
